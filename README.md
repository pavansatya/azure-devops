# Cloud Fundamentals

This repository contains all the details related to my journey at I Net Software Technologies Inc., my OPT employer, where I was learning the fundamentals of different types of cloud, such as Azure and AWS. 

- First couple of weeks, I got introduced to all the primary resources that Azure offers, such as resource groups, capacities, tenant settings, event hub, and function apps. Followed by setting up a trial account and getting all the permissions under the organisation, managing different users in that organisation by assigning roles and permissions using Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
- From the third week, I was introduced to the Microsoft Fabric, an all-in-one unified analytics platform by Azure. We started with architectures, ETL, semantic layers, workspaces, Onelake and several other resources that are used in Fabric for the next three weeks.
